  I am deeply Interested in the World of Technology , Where majority of our life aspects is operated by the Electronic Machines running through 0 & 1 bit ,
  from early morning of Alarm clock on phone to education,business,economy and the whole civilization is depended upon the Machines. We biological human being have already become a cyborg.
  we are cyborg connected with smart phones , Pcs and we are continuously teaching the non-biological Machines to become more smarter than human mind.And its happening right now in 21st Century.
  so learning the Programming languages to adapt self me in the race of Technology.
